public class RealLifeFor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
// You’re managing a parking lot that has 3 floors, and each floor has 10 parking spots.
// Write a Java program using nested for loops to display which spots are available and which are occupied.
// Assume:
// Spots with even numbers are occupied.
for(int spot = 2; spot <=10; spot++){
    
}
// Spots with odd numbers are available
       
// Floor 1:
// Spot 1 - Available
// Spot 2 - Occupied
// Spot 3 - Available
// ...

// Floor 3:
// Spot 10 - Occupied
// ```

// ---

// **Concept Covered:**

// * Outer loop → floors
// * Inner loop → parking spots
// * Conditional inside inner loop (even/odd check)

// Would you like me to show the actual Java code for this scenario?
