// ðŸš— Question: "Fuel Station Simulation"
// Write a Java program that simulates cars fueling at different pumps in a fuel station.
// Requirements:
// There are 3 fuel pumps.
// Each pump serves 5 cars.
// Use nested for loops to represent each pump and each car.
// For every car:
// Generate a random fuel amount between 5 and 50 liters.
// If the fuel amount is below 20, print: "Car needs a small refill".
// If itâ€™s 20 to 40, print: "Car needs a medium refill".
// Otherwise, print: "Car needs a full refill".
// Display total fuel dispensed per pump at the end.
